**Autocoder: A GitHub Action for Automated Code Generation with ChatGPT**

Autocoder is a GitHub Action designed to automate code generation by leveraging the power of OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT. This action allows developers to integrate AI-driven code generation seamlessly into their workflows, making it easier to generate boilerplate code, documentation, or even complex algorithms.

When triggered, Autocoder interacts with ChatGPT to generate code based on custom prompts provided by the user. It sends the prompt to the model, processes the response, and then writes the generated code into a new file or modifies an existing one in the repository. Autocoder can be set to run on specific branches or triggered manually through workflow dispatch events.

After generating the code, Autocoder creates a pull request (PR) with the changes, allowing the team to review the AI-generated code before merging it. This process ensures that the generated code undergoes proper review and testing, maintaining code quality.

By automating the code creation process, Autocoder reduces repetitive tasks and accelerates development. It is especially useful for generating standard patterns, scaffolding new projects, or quickly producing snippets of code based on specific instructions. Autocoder empowers developers to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving while the AI handles the repetitive coding tasks.
